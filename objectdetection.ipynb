Let me show you how!\n","\n","### Step 1: Creating project\n","\n","Before you start, you need to create a Roboflow [account](https://app.roboflow.com/login). Once you do that, you can create a new project in the Roboflow [dashboard](https://app.roboflow.com/). Keep in mind to choose the right project type.

You can do it via API or through our [web interface](https://docs.roboflow.com/adding-data/object-detection).\n","\n","If you drag and drop a directory with a dataset in a supported format, the Roboflow dashboard will automatically read the images and annotations together.\n","\n","<div align=\"center\">\n","  <img\n","    width=\"640\"\n","    src=\"https://media.roboflow.com/preparing-custom-dataset-example/uploading-images.gif?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1672929808290\"\n","  >\n","</div>\n","\n","### Step 3: Labeling\n","\n","If you only have images, you can label them in [Roboflow Annotate](https://docs.roboflow.com/annotate).\n","\n","<div align=\"center\">\n","  <img\n","    width=\"640\"\n","    src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26109316/210901980-04861efd-dfc0-4a01-9373-13a36b5e1df4.gif\"\n","  >\n","</div>\n","\n","### Step 4: Generate new dataset version\n","\n","Now that we have our images and annotations added, we can Generate a Dataset Version.
